# Cables

*When something is called a cable, it is usually in reference to something that carries signal from one point to another.*

- **Patch cables** - cables meant for carrying signal over short distance. Examples include Eurorack patch cables, guitar pedal patch cables, etc.
- **Dual cables** - cables that are attached but carry independent signals
- **Snakes** - multiple cables (think 5+) bound together that carry independent signals

### Phone type cables
