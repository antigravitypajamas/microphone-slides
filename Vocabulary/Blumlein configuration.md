# Blumlein configuration

*In 1931 Alan Blumlein invented stereo recording. It uses two figure-8/bidirectional ribbon microphones angled at 90 degrees and mounted in close proximity along the vertical axis. This results in a recording that closely resembles what human ears hear, as opposed to other stereo recording techniques.*
