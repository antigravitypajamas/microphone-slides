# Human vs. Scientific Listening

### Scientific listening
- **Amplitude** - strength of some aspect of the signal
- **Frequency** - cycles per second
- **Polarity** - the direction in relation to the starting position
- **Phase** - the timing of when a signal starts, stops

### Human listening
- **Volume** - the human perception of amplitude
- **Pitch** - the human perception of frequency
- **Timbre** - the human perception of various frequencies present in a sound; the *quality* of the sound
