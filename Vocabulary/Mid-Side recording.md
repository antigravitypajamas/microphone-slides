# Mid/Side (M/S) recording

*Blumlein again, this time in 1933. A technique used extensively in broadcast because when properly recorded, it always is mono compatible. The "Mid" acts as a center channel and the "Side" creates ambience and directionality by adding or subtracting information (signal) from either side.*
