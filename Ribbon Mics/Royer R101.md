### Notes
- Works brilliantly with bright sources like brass, close strings, percussion, etc.
- Notibly brighter on rear of mic, intentional result of the offset ribbon transducer design. For example, crisper results on an accoustic guitar
- Great for vocals with resonance free top end. However, having a separate pop screen is a must have
