- Lots of proximity effect

At the time of writing, I could not find a polar pattern. However, there are multiple comparisons to the RCA 44. Being a velocity microphone as well, it seems likely that the PB-90 is bidirectional. The following images are pulled from the [Coutant entry on the RCA 44](https://coutant.org/rca44bx/).
